# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We were informed that the file used for the original Student District Analysis, students_complete.csv file, shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards.

For this reason, the math and reading scores for Thomas High School were replaced with NaNs (not a number) while keeping the rest of the data intact. After replacement with NaNs, the school district analysis was redone.  

## Results: Changing the Thomas High School 9th Grade math and reading scores affected the following:
- **District summary: no significant change**
  -  **Orginal:**
       % Passing Math-75.0	% Passing Reading-85.8 % Overall Passing-65.2
  -  **Re-analysis:**
       % Passing Math-74.8	% Passing Reading-85.7 % Overall Passing-64.9
- **School summary:** there was significant change if number of 9th graders were factored into the calculation but did not      make a difference when the count of 9th grade students were removed from the total number of Thomas High Schools            Students
